# Truncation & Archimedean Solids

**The Concept:** Slicing the sharp corners off Platonic solids to create a new family of shapes called Archimedean solids (e.g., turning an Icosahedron into a soccer ball).

**In Practice:** Used extensively in cutting gemstones to maximize light refraction, and in structural engineering to create geodesic domes with flattened connection points.

**Demonstration:**
Use the "Truncate" slider. As you slide it, the vertices visibly split and slide down their connected edges, turning points into new polygonal faces.
