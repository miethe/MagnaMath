# Descartes' Theorem of Total Angle Deficit

**The Concept:** The "missing" angle required to flatten a 3D corner is its Angle Deficit. The sum of all angle deficits for any convex polyhedron is exactly 720°.

**In Practice:** Used in differential geometry to calculate the Gaussian curvature of complex surfaces, and in robotics to understand spatial constraints and kinematics.

**Demonstration:**
Highlight one vertex on a 3D model. Unfold just that vertex into 2D to visually show the "pie slice" gap (the deficit). A running tally adds up the deficits for every vertex, always hitting 720°.
