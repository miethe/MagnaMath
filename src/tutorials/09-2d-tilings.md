# 2D Tilings (Planar Tessellations)

**The Concept:** For shapes to lay perfectly flat without gaps or overlaps, the interior angles of the polygons meeting at a single point must sum exactly to 360°.

**In Practice:** Floor tiling, textile pattern design, and masonry.

**Demonstration:**
A top-down sandbox mode restricted by your physical inventory. When you snap shapes together, an overlay appears at the joining vertex showing a circular protractor summing the angles (e.g., 90 + 90 + 90 + 90 = 360).
