# Dual Polyhedra

**The Concept:** Every polyhedron has a dual created by placing a vertex at the center of every face and connecting them. This mathematically swaps the number of Faces and Vertices.

**In Practice:** Used in crystallography to map atomic structures, and in pathfinding algorithms (converting Voronoi diagrams to Delaunay triangulations).

**Demonstration:**
Start with a solid Platonic solid. A glowing dot appears at the center of each face. Wireframe lines connect the dots, revealing the hidden dual shape inside.
