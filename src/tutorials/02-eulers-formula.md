# Euler's Formula

**The Concept:** For any convex polyhedron, the Vertices (V), Edges (E), and Faces (F) relate via the formula: `V - E + F = 2`.

**In Practice:** Euler's Formula is foundational in network topology and is actively used in 3D modeling software and game engines to validate mesh integrity (ensuring a 3D model doesn't have "holes" or non-manifold geometry).

**Demonstration:**
As you change the shape, watch the numbers for V, E, and F tick up or down like an odometer. No matter how complex the shape gets, the final result always instantly resolves to 2!
