# Symmetry & Reflection

**The Concept:** Reflecting a shape across an axis by multiplying coordinates by -1, and resolving the "Winding Order Problem" by reversing vertex indices so normals face outward.

**In Practice:** Essential in 3D character modeling (artists only model half a face and mirror it), architectural drafting, and data compression (storing only half a model's data to save memory).

**Demonstration:**
A translucent, glowing "mirror plane" appears on the X, Y, or Z axis. As you build on one side, the geometry actively clones and merges on the other.
