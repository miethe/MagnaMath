# Polyhedra & Platonic Solids

**The Concept:** The 5 Platonic Solids are the only regular, convex polyhedra where all faces are congruent regular polygons and the same number of faces meet at every vertex.

**In Practice:** These highly symmetric shapes are used in dice manufacturing (d4, d6, d8, d12, d20), understanding molecular structures in chemistry (e.g., methane is tetrahedral), and designing architectural geodesic frames.

**Demonstration:**
Notice the 5 shapes floating side-by-side. If you look closely at any vertex (corner), you will see the exact same number of faces meeting there, no matter which vertex you choose on a given shape.
